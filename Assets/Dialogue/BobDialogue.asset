    MessageText: Hey there, how were your few hours of sleep last night? Mine were
      terrific! Did you hear! They fired that slacker Rick! I'm glad too, he was
      making us look bad. They've replaced him with a robot for now, but I'm sure
      it's just temporary until they find a good ol' fashioned hard working American.
      See you on the floor!

    MessageText: Hey there, I'm Bob, I'm new here as well. Gosh, isn't this great,
      this seems like a great place to work. Simple unending reptetitive tasks, now
      that's the job for me! Just need to grab Boxes, fill em up and put em on the
      conveyor! This is going to be great, I'm sure all those horror stories about
      piss bottles and robots aren't true.

    MessageText: Hey there, what a great day today is! Phew, I'm beat, working hard
      the last couple days. Good for the soul though. Lucky we have this Regular
      Gum around, keeps me on my feet! The second dispenser's in stock again too!
      Thank goodness that they replaced Aric, it seems like he was single-handedly
      keeping it out of stock! Haopy Working!
